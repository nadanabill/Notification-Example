# Notification Example ‚ú®

A Flutter application showing the implementation of three types of notifications (Local, FCM, and OneSignal) managed through a centralized notification service. This project showcases best practices for integrating and handling notifications in a Flutter application.

## ü™Ñ Features
- **Local Notifications**: Schedule and display local notifications using the `flutter_local_notifications` package.
- **Push Notifications**: Implement remote notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and OneSignal.
- **In-App Notifications**: Handle in-app alerts for real-time user interaction.

## üõ† Dependencies
- **flutter_local_notifications**: For scheduling and displaying local notifications.
- **permission_handler**: To manage notification permissions.
- **timezone**: For handling time when scheduling notifications.
- **firebase_core**: For integrating Firebase.
- **firebase_messaging**: For sending and receiving push notifications.
- **onesignal_flutter**: For enhanced push notification capabilities.

## ü§û Notification Types
This project implements three types of notifications:

1. **Local Notifications**:
   - Powered by the `flutter_local_notifications` package.
   - Allows scheduling and displaying notifications locally on the device.

2. **Push Notifications**:
   - Integrated with Firebase Cloud Messaging and OneSignal for remote notifications.
   - Supports sending notifications from a server or external service.

3. **In-App Notifications**:
   - Displays real-time alerts within the app for user interaction.

## üñáÔ∏è Notification Service
A centralized notification service system is implemented using three dedicated service files to handle all notification-related functionality:
- `firebase_cloud_messaging_service.dart`: Manages Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
- `local_notification_service.dart`: Handles local notifications using the `flutter_local_notifications` package.
- `onesignal_service.dart`: Integrates OneSignal for enhanced push notification capabilities.
- Collectively, these files initialize and configure their respective notification services, manage permission requests, and provide methods to trigger notifications.
- Ensures a unified interface for all notification types, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Example usage:
```dart
final notificationService = NotificationService();
await notificationService.init();
await notificationService.showLocalNotification(
  id: 1,
  title: 'Welcome',
  body: 'This is a local notification!',
);
```
